High-level overview of Object-Oriented Concepts:

- Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) – What: Focuses on understanding and defining the problem by identifying objects, their attributes, and relationships.

- Object-Oriented Design (OOD) – How: Describes how to structure the system, creating classes, defining methods, and deciding on interactions between objects.

- Object-Oriented Design Principles – Guidelines for quality OOD: Provides best practices to ensure a maintainable, flexible, and scalable design (e.g., SOLID principles).

- Object-Oriented Design Patterns – Reusable solutions to common problems in OOD: Time-tested solutions to recurring design problems (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer patterns).

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Implementation: The coding phase, where the design is translated into actual software using OOP languages (e.g., Java, C++, Python).
